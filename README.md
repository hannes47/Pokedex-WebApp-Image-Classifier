# PokedexWebImgClassifier
Pokédex Web App for Image Classification of Pokémon

Start the server by running app.py
The model works, when you copy "Pokemon_Resnet101_stage-3.pth" to models/ from the google drive:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YXFXtL8jnlKgSvL5WvezTK7ww3kHs4eT

On the drive you can also retrain the model by running Pokemon.ipynb. The data is in Pokemon.zip
